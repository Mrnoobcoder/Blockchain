Posiedon_hash.py is the python code to generate Poseidon hash

Input:  [0, 1, 2, 3]
Output:  0x82c67c171f246d7b0336670d1f42cfa5149c948d9213bf72d33cf8451e04bfa

When I am taking this hex or integer value (after converting) value as public Input I am getting assertion failed.

When I am taking only string i.e. removing 0x then we get an error that Not able to convert it into BigInt.

Same error with Sha256.

input.json is in transaction_js folder.
